#Project Title: HIGH FIVE ROBOT ARM 

##Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzHVLNFwgE8&feature=youtu.be

Getting Started: Hardware: 1 - Arduino Uno Board; 2 - Servo motors; 1 – Painted Cardboard hand; 1 -  Distance IR Sensor; Wires; Metal Links for the arm; Platform to secure your arm.

Software: Install Arduino from arduino.cc and include Servo library. The code that was used is attached to the folder.

1.	Connect servo motors to ground, 5V, and digital pins, 6 and 7.
2.	Designed cardboard hand 
3.	Assembled robot arm with metal links and zip ties

Software:


1.	Added Servo1 objects.
2.	Wired servo motors to breadboard
3.	Added IR sensor to detect range of distance
4.	Map values from 0 to 1023 to desired degree i.e. from 0 to 180.
5.	Reassign values to correspond with sensor using mapped Position X as our variable 
6.	Added mapped Y on processing for left- right motion on servo2
7.	Write those values to servo for sweep in up and down motion.
8.	Read the values from analog input for a IR sensor

What we learned: How to integrate materials and software, e.g. Arduino, Processing to create useful inventions and tools. Also, we learned how to troubleshoot bugs and successfully demonstrate our creation.
