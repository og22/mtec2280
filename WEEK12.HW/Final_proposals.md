Project 1: http://www.instructables.com/id/Reprogrammable-Arduino-Synthesizer/

For my first project I chose an Arduino Synthesizer because I like the sounds it can produce. For this project, I would need to learn how to add the required part and components into a safe and easy to use control box. 

Project 2: http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-robot-arm-1/

For my second project I chose an Arduino robot arm because I like animatronic devices. For this project, I would need to learn how to construct an movable arm that can bend and rotate while programming it all together. 


Project 3: http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Door-Alarm-With-Keypad/

For my third project I chose an Arduino door alarm because It seems fun. For this project, I would need to learn how to program the access code into the device and make sure its working properly.
